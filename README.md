This is everything you need to set up a RUSForma Vehicles PARTS Trader in the Expansion Mod Market.

THIS IS A PARTS ONLY TRADER

The parts are all divided up into variants under the main model name. All the types errors, non-existent vehicle additions & incorrect variant names (mostly from other RUSForma mods) that were in files I got in the wild have been fixed.

I will eventually get to creating a Vehicle Trader, but if people use the stock types.xml & spawnabletypes.xml files that are out there - the nominals for spawning are astronomically high - so they should need parts more than vehicles, lol. 
The nominals have been adjusted in the files I have posted here. I don't have a Trader that sells the vehicles on my servers.

Whenever you get files off the internet from some guy in a dirty old van with FREE CANDY written on the side of it, or if you edit the .xml & .json files yourself - run them through a validator before uploading them to your server

All you should need besides these files to install a RUSForma PARTS Trader is the mod itself: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2536888090&searchtext=rusforma
